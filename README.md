# Houses-to-rent


This dataset has 10692 houses for rent with 13 different classes / This dataset contains 10692 houses to rent with 13 different features( 13 columns x 10692 rows).
Some feature I cand mension hire : city, area, rooms, reant amount.
I will try to choose a model that can predict well  reant amount( target) based on the dataset I have.
For the begining I plot the target with seaborn lib from Python, to explore the target from the dataset.
Because rent amount is a continue value, I diceded to choose some regression estimators for this dataset like: RandomForestRegressor,LinearRegression,DecisionTreeRegressor(), SVM,  Neural_network.
